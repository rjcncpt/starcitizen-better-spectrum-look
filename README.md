# Star Citizen better Spectrum look
I've reworked the CSS code of the Star Citizen Spectrum website a bit, as I'm not happy with the original color scheme. I toned down the intrusive blue of the website a bit. 


## What's needed

You'll need the free Stylus browser extension and my CSS code.

Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/styl-us/

Install the browser extension, click the Stylus icon in your browser, click the Manage button and import the code below. Save and the Spectrum website should look a little different.

Take a look at the screenshots. Before/After.

Update: I've placed the gallery images side by side instead of one below the other. It looks much nicer this way when a post contains multiple photos. See the last screenshot
