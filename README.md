# Spectrum - Better Dark Theme
Better look for the Spectrum website. I've reworked the CSS code of the Star Citizen Spectrum website a bit, as I'm not happy with the original color scheme. I toned down the intrusive blue of the website a bit.

## What's needed

You'll need the free Stylus browser extension and my CSS code.

Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/styl-us/

Install the browser extension, click the stylus icon in your browser, click the Manage button, then click "Create New Style" and copy the code from spectrum.css into the editor window. Give the project a name (top left) and save the project. The Spectrum website should now look slightly different.

Alternatively you can use the browser extension "Code Injector". As URL you have to use this: https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC

Take a look at the screenshots. Before/After.

Update: I've placed the gallery images side by side instead of one below the other. It looks much nicer this way when a post contains multiple photos. See the last screenshot
